Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round.Attention: Does not affect non-cyclical dates such as Purchase Date (PRD), Maturity Date (MD), Termination Date (TD), Capitalization End Date (IPCED) since they can be set to the correct date directly.",

Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round.Attention: Does not affect non-cyclical dates such as Purchase Date (PRD), Maturity Date (MD), Termination Date (TD), Capitalization End Date (IPCED) since they can be set to the correct date directly.",
