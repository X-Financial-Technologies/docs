Phase 1: Requirements & Design

Define Core Requirements:

- Replace payment methods with USDX token transfers
- Include on-chain and off-chain transaction types
- Add stablecoin-specific security requirements
- Consider blockchain performance and scalability needs


API Design:

- Design RESTful endpoints for USDX operations 
- Include stablecoin-specific endpoints (e.g., minting, burning)


Technical Architecture:

- Replace payment service providers with blockchain integration
- Design schema for on-chain and off-chain data
- Add stablecoin-specific microservices:

- Wallet service
- Treasury service
- Compliance service 





Phase 2: Security Implementation

Security Measures:

- Implement blockchain-specific security measures
- Set up multi-signature wallets for treasury management


Compliance:

- Add stablecoin-specific regulatory compliance checks
- Implement KYC/AML procedures 


Phase 3: Core Development

Basic Implementation:

- Implement USDX token smart contracts
- Develop on-chain and off-chain transaction processing


Integration Features:

- Integrate with supported blockchain networks
- Implement cross-chain bridges if required


Support Features:

- Create dashboards for treasury management and compliance monitoring


Phase 4: Testing & Validation

Testing Strategy:

- Add blockchain-specific tests (e.g., smart contract audits)
- Implement simulations for various market conditions


Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment

Documentation:

- Include guides for integrating USDX in various use cases


Deployment:

- Consider blockchain-specific deployment strategies


Phase 6: Post-Launch

Maintenance Plan:

- Monitor blockchain network health
- Track token supply and reserves


Scaling Strategy:

- Optimize for blockchain scalability
- Implement layer 2 solutions if needed


Key Technical Considerations:

- Ensure deterministic transaction processing
- Implement robust treasury management
- Design for interoperability with other blockchain networks
